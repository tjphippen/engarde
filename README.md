**Archived package from a previous 2016 project**. (*no judgement*)

Developed a CRM for the alarm dealers/security system industry. Engarde was used prior but was unable to provide an API for quite some time. Initially used this for some basic functions/automation. Engarde did eventually offer a VERY limited API endpoints however this package was no longer needed after it's last use to migrate all the alarm dealer's customers/data to the newly developed CRM(skeletor)

This is hacky BUT was the only way to export/migrate ALL data, may be used again to do so bu configuring with a dealer's **SUBDOMAIN.engarde-acd.com
**OR could be utilized to more easily access information as was done initially for door to door sales mobile apps.

Used https://goutte.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ & https://symfony.com/doc/2.0/components/dom_crawler.html
